## Welcome to Jeremiah's ML coding challenges repo 
I saw that a lot of the algorithms I learnt during my numerical methods class at University
are on deep-ml so I thought it would be nice to implement them while writing clean 
and robust functions. 

I am interested in applying my numerical methods knowledge to physics and AI problems
so I thought this would be a good start.
